# to elaine and phong:
This is a bit more of a manual way to make sure we all have the same stuff than if the unity teams system actually worked
<br>
that being said we need to be on the same page about how github works:
  - To get all the changes made in the repository, you'll have to **pull** from it
  - If you want to make changes you'll need to **commit** those changes then **push** them to the repo
<br>
please feel free to ask me for help with anything
<br>
also this tutorial will be extremely helpful for this project: https://learn.unity.com/project/ruby-s-2d-rpg
